Encryption:

Considering the limited time, I foresee problems in using a tool that will encrypt all fields in the database. 

The encryption schemes do not offer ordering (if they did, the encryption would be breakable using binary search. 

For all encrypted fields, we would lose the following: ordering, sorting, searches with partial text, indexes
that span more than one field. In our site, searching would break, and we can only search for exact matches. 

Any search indexing (like elastic search) would weaken the encryption, as data may be inferred from the search 
index itself.

To simplify the solution I’ll use the symmetric encryption package django-fernet-fields. 
The most vulnerable data is the card itself, so I’ll just encrypt that.

I believe this is a good quick compromise, as it is not going to break anything, yet it protects the most 
important part – the money (the card).



Key management:

Storing the symmetric encryption key defeats the purpose of the encryption. 
I'll add the package python-decouple and store the key in the .env file.
